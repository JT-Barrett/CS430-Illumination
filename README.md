# CS430-Illumination
CS 430 Project 3: Illumination

This repository contains the project files for a ray caster that incorporates the representation of lights and illumination.

The following issues are present in this implementation:
- Spotlight does not seem to get angular atinuation right

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
- Navigate to the directory with project files in console
- Call "make"
- Use the following command pattern to run: ./raycast.exe width height input.json output.ppm

If you wish to make the image rectangular, make sure you update the camera to identical proportions. If you don't you will get a distorted image.

Sample input files and output files from the project spec and of my own creation are provided.
